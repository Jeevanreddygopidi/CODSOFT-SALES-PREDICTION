📊 Sales Prediction Using Python
This project involves building a Sales Prediction model using Linear Regression to forecast the sales of a product based on advertising expenditure across various channels such as TV, Radio, and Newspaper. This project was completed as part of my internship at Codsoft.

🚀 Project Overview
In this project, I aimed to predict the Sales of products based on advertising investments. The model is trained on a dataset containing advertising expenditures for TV, Radio, and Newspaper mediums.

The main steps in this project include:

Data Preprocessing: Cleaning and preparing the data.
Model Building: Training a Linear Regression model to predict sales.
Evaluation: Using metrics like Mean Squared Error (MSE) and R-squared to evaluate the performance.
Visualization: Plotting Actual vs Predicted Sales to visualize model accuracy.
📂 Dataset
The dataset used for this project is advertising.csv which contains the following columns:

TV: Advertising expenditure on TV.
Radio: Advertising expenditure on Radio.
Newspaper: Advertising expenditure on Newspaper.
Sales: Sales of the product.
🛠️ Technologies Used
Python
pandas and NumPy for data manipulation
Scikit-learn for machine learning and regression
Matplotlib and Seaborn for visualization
📊 Project Workflow
Data Loading & Preprocessing:

Load the dataset using pandas.
Handle missing data and check for outliers.
Data Splitting:

Split the data into training and testing sets (80% training, 20% testing).
Model Building:

Train a Linear Regression model using Scikit-learn.
Evaluation:

Evaluate the model using Mean Squared Error (MSE) and R-Squared Score.
Visualization:

Plot Actual vs Predicted Sales to visually assess the model's performance.
🧑‍💻 How to Run
